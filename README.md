Rock paper scissor game without interface
 
update# 11/14/2023
addded the functionality of comparing the users input and enemy's randomize pick
then converts that into numbers, then those numbers will be checked in another 
function that contains nested if else statements.

the code is not yet rafactored, i think it has a betterway to compare the values of the 2
but for now the code works fine. will add UI later when i study DOM manipulation :)
